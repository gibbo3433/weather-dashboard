# Week-6-Weather-Dashboard

# Challenge 6: 

## Creating a weather dashboard

### User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Issues identified and corrected

- Adding to the local memory and then making sure it was saved for future uses

I needed to work on making sure I located the data I needed to save to local memoruy and then make sure I reloaded it into the calendar
once it reopened again and wasn't lost.

- Changing the correct colours for the past, present and future styles

Creating an 'if, else if, else' function linked with the moment.js was difficult as I needed to make sure each newly created div was correcrtly styled
depending on the time of the day.

## Future work

- Change text styling on page 
- Add extra buttons for check-boxes on tasks

I have added HTML alt: notes, CSS /*notes*/ and Javascript //notes to help any future edits by making it easier to see what the different elements are in the code and if any collaboration work will be done in the future.
